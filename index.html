        <p>welcome to the ADOPT-A-DOG foundation. we beleive every dog deserves a family or friend to love and care for them. We try our hardest to find as many good homes for these good bois and gurls. feel free to peruse through the different dogs we are currently trying to find a family for and shedule some time to come down and meet/play with them to see if you are a good fit for eachother. we also offer training classes for puppies and seperate classes for older dogs who wanna learn new tricks! </p>
